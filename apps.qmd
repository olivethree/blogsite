## [Shiny Reverse Correlation: Sampling Subgroup CIs](https://olivethree.shinyapps.io/shinyRC_subgroup_cis/)

This shiny app facilitates the generation of the so-called 'subgroup' classification images (CIs) for a two-phase reverse correlation methodology.

Read the post at [Blog](https://manueloliveira.nl/posts/p_2/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@manueljbo/improved-two-phase-reverse-correlation-method-in-psychological-research-overview-and-r-tutorial-dfb66f95553c)

The use of subgroup CIs is a currently recommended practice in psychological research involving a two-phase variant of the psychophysical reverse correlation method (e.g. [Dotsch & Todorov, 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550611430272)). In practice, this implies using the data collected during the first phase (reverse correlation task) to generate multiple group-level CIs associated with the same target construct condition (i.e. several 'Trustworthy' subgroup CIs vs. single 'Trustworthy' group CI ). These are then rated in the second phase by another group of raters.

Using subgroup CIs helps decrease the number of images to rate in the second phase, compared to the alternative but more time consuming option of rating all the individual CIs generated by each participant in the first phase. This approach circumvents the issues (e.g. type I error inflation) associated with using a single group CI in the second phase (see [Cone et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550620938616)).

# [Face Masker](https://github.com/olivethree/webcam_face_masker){#face-masker}

**Real-time webcam face masking**

This application applies a facial mask to any faces captured by the webcam. You can also take snapshots and store them in jpeg format. It was developed during my free time as a hobby project, years before AI chatbots could do this for me in 5 seconds. I leave it up to you to decide how useful this app/code may be to you. The app is quite limited and I stopped working on it a long time ago, but maybe it can inspire you to start something better :)

**Running the app**: For now, the only way to run the Face Masker app is from source code "\~/src/**facemasker_main.py**" script.
