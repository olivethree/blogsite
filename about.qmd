I am a scientist and strategist working at the intersection of **Social Psychology** and **Artificial Intelligence**. Currently, I serve as a researcher and advisor at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), focusing on the critical integration of AI in Education.

My background is rooted in **Social Cognition**. For over a decade, I have researched how humans form impressions and trust based on facial appearance and social categories. I now apply these frameworks to a new frontier: understanding how humans perceive and interact with artificial agents.

### **Industry & Academia**

Between academic roles, I worked for some time as a **Data Modeller & Researcher at Philips**. This experience grounded my scientific research background in technical reality, where I learned to translate data insights into viable steps required to build clinical software, while navigating complex product constraints. I combine this industrial discipline with technical proficiency in coding (R, Python), building custom tools to support statistical analyses (e.g., [oddPower](https://olivethree.shinyapps.io/oddpoweR/)) or Generative AI literacy tools ([CARefully prompt](https://zenodo.org/records/15475953)).

### **Converting research into practice: AI in Education**

At TU/e, I play a supportive role in the university’s operational response to Generative AI. As a member of the **Taskforce AI in Education**, I translate research output into practical, institutional strategy. My work involves designing and leading activities to help stakeholders (faculty, support staff, students) adapt to educational transformation, specifically in redefining assessment methods and upskilling staff for an AI-integrated reality.
