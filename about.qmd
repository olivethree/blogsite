My name is **Manuel Oliveira** (he/him). Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at **Eindhoven University of Technology** working on the topic of **AI in Education**.

I have a background in Psychology and my doctoral work focused on the relation between personality stereotypes and social attributions based on facial appearance. Most of the work I've done in the past years involved statistics, programming (R & Python), experimental design, and scientific writing. After my Ph.D. I moved on to an R&D industry job where I gained further experience with coding skills, how businesses operate, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, and working with teams with diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. During that period, I became increasingly interested in the challenges emerging from the growing presence of AI in society. This led me to seek new roles where I could learn more about how people interact with technology in general, and more specifically AI. I found my first opportunity to work on this topic in a postdoctoral position at Utrecht University, where I spent my time research topics of trust in AI and human-AI interaction in general.

Since 2024, I'm working on the topic of AI in Education as a postdoctoral researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology.
