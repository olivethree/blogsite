    "text": "Welcome to my personal website!\nI have a background in Psychology and my doctoral work focused on the relation between personality stereotypes and social attributions based on facial appearance. Most of the work I’ve done in the past years involved statistics, programming, experimental design, and scientific writing. After my Ph.D. I moved on to an R&D industry job where I learned tons about coding, business, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and working with teams with diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. During that period, I became increasingly interested in the challenges of harmonizing human psychology and behavior with the growing presence of AI in society.\nCurrently, I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University on topics of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence research in general."

    "text": "This shiny app facilitates the generation of the so-called ‘subgroup’ classification images (CIs) for a two-phase reverse correlation methodology.\nRead the associated Mediumblogpost\nThe use of subgroup CIs is a currently recommended practice in psychological research involving a two-phase variant of the psychophysical reverse correlation method (e.g. Dotsch & Todorov, 2012). In practice, this implies using the data collected during the first phase (reverse correlation task) to generate multiple group-level CIs associated with the same target construct condition (i.e. several ‘Trustworthy’ subgroup CIs vs. single ‘Trustworthy’ group CI ). These are then rated in the second phase by another group of raters.\nUsing subgroup CIs helps decrease the number of images to rate in the second phase, compared to the alternative but more time consuming option of rating all the individual CIs generated by each participant in the first phase. This approach circumvents the issues (e.g. type I error inflation) associated with using a single group CI in the second phase (see Cone et al., 2021).\nFor more details see: https://github.com/olivethree/shinyrc_subgroupcis"

    "text": "Random File Sampler\nI wrote this program with the goal of automating the random sampling of face images from databases. This is useful to anyone looking to prevent any bias in image file selection. This program randomly samples (without replacement) files of any given extension from a folder. The sampled files are then copied to a new folder together with a .txt file listing the sampled file names. For reproducibility, the program uses a fixed pseudo-random generator seed number (seed=1234). Alternatively, you can set your own custom seed number. In the last updates, I added a user-friendly interface and created a Windows installer for the application.\nFor Windows users:\nDownload Random File Sampler (Windows Installer, 18.7 MB)\nFor Mac OS users (source code only):\nDownload Random File Sampler source code (18.2 MB)"

    "section": "Why behavioral science should guide AI development",
    "text": "Why behavioral science should guide AI development\nAs I see it, knowledge about human psychology and behavior should be the guiding light in the development of smart tools (or AI tools if you prefer) serving society and people. It is my belief that a human-centered approach to AI development will not only catalyze progress in most societal domains, but also boost the competitiveness of entrepreneurial ventures invested in the crucial task of translating the promises of AI into more tangible products and services.\nImportantly, I believe that we should raise awareness in the AI development community about all the harmful human biases that have hindered human progress to this day (e.g. prejudice of any kind). Therefore, I firmly defend we should find better ways of educating our “AI” systems, by preventing biased artificial behavior as much as we can.\nFinally, although I’ve been mostly ranting about how psychological science benefits AI development, this collaboration is a win-win for both parties. Psychology and related behavioral sciences have much to learn about how the dawn of AI in our society is impacting human behavior and mental processes. For instance, “Are smart tools making us lazier?”, “How is our memory being affected by smart tools?”, “How is AI impacting our mental and behavioral development across the life-span?”, among many other interesting questions one can start to think of – psst…if you’re interested in the future of AI, I recommend reading “Human Compatible” by Stuart Russell 😉. It is my hope that the attempts to answer such questions will throw light on the malleability of our behavior and mind processes during sigificant environmental changes, as well as expose a bit more of what pieces of our mental and behavioral machinery remain stoically invariant throughout the tides of time and progress.\nDate: 19 August 2022\nAuthor: M.
