    "text": "Retrieved from https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2012\n\n\nAs I see it, knowledge about human psychology and behavior should be the guiding light in the development of smart tools (or AI tools if you prefer) serving society and people. It is my belief that a human-centered approach to AI development will not only catalyze progress in most societal domains, but also boost the competitiveness of entrepreneurial ventures invested in the crucial task of translating the promises of AI into more tangible products and services.\nImportantly, I believe that we should raise awareness in the AI development community about all the harmful human biases that have hindered human progress to this day (e.g.¬†prejudice of any kind). Therefore, I firmly defend we should find better ways of educating our ‚ÄúAI‚Äù systems, by preventing biased artificial behavior as much as we can.\nFinally, although I‚Äôve been mostly ranting about how psychological science benefits AI development, this collaboration is a win-win for both parties. Psychology and related behavioral sciences have much to learn about how the dawn of AI in our society is impacting human behavior and mental processes. For instance, ‚ÄúAre smart tools making us lazier?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow is our memory being affected by smart tools?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow is AI impacting our mental and behavioral development across the life-span?‚Äù, among many other interesting questions one can start to think of -- psst‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre interested in the future of AI, I recommend reading ‚Äú[Human Compatible](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem-ebook/dp/B07N5J5FTS)‚Äù by Stuart Russell üòâ. It is my hope that the attempts to answer such questions will throw light on the malleability of our behavior and mind processes during sigificant environmental changes, as well as expose a bit more of what pieces of our mental and behavioral *machinery* remain stoically invariant throughout the tides of time and progress."

    "text": "Psychology & Artificial Intelligence | Social Perception | Data Analysis | R | Python\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my personal website!\nI have a background in Psychology and my doctoral work focused on the relation between personality stereotypes and social attributions based on facial appearance. Most of the work I‚Äôve done in the past years involved statistics, programming, experimental design, and scientific writing. After my Ph.D.¬†I moved on to an R&D industry job where I learned tons about coding, business, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and working with teams with diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. During that period, I became increasingly interested in the challenges of harmonizing human psychology and behavior with the growing presence of AI in society.\nCurrently, I‚Äôm working as a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University on topics of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence research in general."

There are some limitations in version 1.0 that need improvement, especially the ‚Äúlaggy‚Äù frame rate.\nRunning the app: For now, the only way to run the Face Masker app is from source code ‚Äú~/src/facemasker_main.py‚Äù script.\nDownload Face Masker source code"
